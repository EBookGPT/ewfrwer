Please provide the information requested so I can help you critique your book and create a revised outline. 

Specifically, I need:

1. **The original plan:**
    * Title and genre 
    * Basic plot outline
2. **The critique:**
    * Feedback you've received on your original plan 
3. **Your goals:**
    * Changes you want to make based on the critique 
    * What you hope to achieve with the revised outline

Once you give me this information, I can offer a harsh but constructive critique and help you move forward with your book.
