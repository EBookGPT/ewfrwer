Please provide the input that should be inserted. I need the updated plan or notes for the book to create the outline. 

For example, you could provide:

* **A revised version of the original plan with specific changes based on the critique.**
* **New ideas for characters, plot, setting, or themes.** 
* **Specific details about the characters, setting, or plot that weren't included in the original plan.**

Once you provide the input, I can create a 3-chapter outline based on your revised plan.
