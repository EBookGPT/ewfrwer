I need more information to help you with your book outline. Please provide: 

1. **The original plan:** What is the current title and genre of your book? What is the basic plot outline?  
2. **The critique:** What feedback did you receive on your original plan? 
3. **Your goals:** What changes do you want to make to your book based on the critique? What are you hoping to achieve with the revised outline?

Once you provide this information, I can help you create a revised plan and a 3-chapter outline that meets your needs. 


Please provide the following information so I can write chapter 2 of your 3-chapter outline:

1. **The revised plan:** What are the main changes you've made to your original plan based on the critique and your goals? 
2. **Chapter 1 details:** What happened in chapter 1? What is the main conflict or problem facing the protagonist? What is the protagonist's goal? 
3. **Chapter 2 direction:**  What should happen in chapter 2 to further the plot and move the story forward? What new challenges or obstacles should the protagonist face? What should the protagonist learn or discover in this chapter?

Once you provide this information, I can create a detailed outline for chapter 2. 


Please provide the following information so I can write chapter 3 of your 3-chapter outline:

1. **The revised plan:** What are the main changes you've made to your original plan based on the critique and your goals? 
2. **Chapter 1 & 2 details:** What happened in chapters 1 and 2? What is the main conflict or problem facing the protagonist? What is the protagonist's goal? How has the protagonist changed or grown since the beginning of the story?
3. **Chapter 3 direction:**  What should happen in chapter 3 to resolve the main conflict and bring the story to a satisfying conclusion? What should the protagonist do to achieve their goal? How should the protagonist's relationship with other characters change or evolve? 

Once you provide this information, I can create a detailed outline for chapter 3.
